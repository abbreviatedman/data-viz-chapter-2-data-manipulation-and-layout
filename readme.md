# Data Visualization Chapter 2 - Setup and Introduction

How to use this repository:

- `explore.ipynb` and `app.py` are the files you will work in.
- `endpoint.ipynb` and `solution.py` are the "solution" to the work you'll do in this section.
- `chipotle.csv`, `nasdaq.csv`, and `largest-companies.csv` are the data files we'll use.

This repository is designed to be run _locally_. Open all files in your editorâ€”preferably Visual Studio Code. `explore.ipynb` is your starting point.
